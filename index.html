    <div class="container" id="top"><p class="welcome">Welcome to the home of Bridge Echo! We are a a small music studio in the UK that provide a range of
         audio services from recording and tracking to beat programmming and more. We specialise in the arrangement of string sections and recording of string
          parts, however we also work with many types of music production duties. Using 
        a collection of analogue and digital equipment, we have many years experience working across different genres and in different mediums. 
        Most of our work is done remotely - 
        we send out all finished files in a high quality lossless format or anything of your choosing. </p>

    <div class="container3"><p class="textbox3">With many years of experience in playing, production and sound engineering, we
        work with a small roster of classically trained professional musicians alongside our in-house violinist. From string players to saxophonists, we can write, arrange and record lines for your song, film or production. If you 
    want the sound of real string quartet, no problem! We have worked on a finely-honed method of multi-tracking to achieve the sound without the costs of hiring four
    musicians. Check out in more detail what we do <a href="services.html"><u>here.</u></a> </p>
